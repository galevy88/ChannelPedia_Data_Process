# convert NWB (HDF5) files into csv file and Pandas dataFrame


in this code I generate Pandas dataframes based on NWB file downloaded form ChanelPedia website.
ChanelPedia contains data of ion channels on brain and the current/time data depended on the vault pass through the channels.

HDF5 is Hirarchial format to organize data and by getting the exact location of the table I could convert
it into csv file and further on to Pandas dataFrame for easier access to this data
